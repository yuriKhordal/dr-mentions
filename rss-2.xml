      <description>For example, this test message should generate four mentions: @whimsical @whimsical @whimsical @whimsical

('should' as in, I suspect it will, correctly it should only generate one)</description>

      <description>@whimsical OHHH, I looked at the XML and THAT'S why there are &quot;duplicates&quot;! The XML file actually DOES show three different items for your message, one for &quot;whimsical mentioned(at)SoldierOfCode&quot; and two(because you mentioned him twice) for (at)Lensflare, but since all three have the same guid the RSS software sees them as one. That's probably the &quot;duplicates&quot; @Lensflare was seeing, in which case it's not duplicates and it works.

Tho you should probablt treat the case where you mention the person more than once in the same message so it'd only generate one item per person.

And for the guid's you could make it instead of `devrant-mention-19384527` be `devrant-mention-19384527-1` for example, and for each additional mention ++ the counter so second mention(in the same message) would be `devrant-mention-19384527-2` and continued</description>

      <description>@whimsical Oh, btw, I just noticed the RSS feed only reports one mention. For example your messgse here was reported as &quot;whimsical mentioned (at)SoldierOfCode&quot; but does report that you also mentioned (at)Lensflare</description>

      <description>@SoldierOfCode aww, thanks. I will look in it today, duplication also mentioned by @Lensflare. But I don't know if I can add the &quot;Add new rant&quot; notifs in this rss because it maybe breaks @Lensflare system that depends on it. Maybe I could make extra rss. Will see how far I get :)</description>

      <description>@whimsical I wouldn't be surprised if it was either malicious or a marketing move... or both.

      <description>@Lensflare I don't quite see myself working with Swift or Kotlin in the foreseeable future, unfortunately. I do quite like Swift though, maybe I'll spend a weekend with it one of these times.</description>

      <description>@Lensflare That's the tragedy, isn't it? Excited to learn it, but crushed by the reality that it'll only ever benefit me in personal projects or academically.</description>
